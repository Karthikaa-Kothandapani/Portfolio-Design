</h3>
      <ul>
        <li class="project1 wires"><snap ="color-change">Flex Sensors:</snap> Flex sensors are installed on poles, wires, or other structures to monitor the angle or bending of wires. These sensors detect when the wires hang below a specific threshold. </li>
        <li class="project1 wires"><snap ="color-change">Signal Detection:</snap> When the wire bends or sags beyond the pre-set threshold (due to factors like wind, wear, or weight), the flex sensor sends a signal to the central monitoring unit.</li>
        <li class="project1 wires"><snap ="color-change">Central Monitoring System (CMS):</snap> The CMS processes the data from the flex sensors and compares the sensor readings with pre-determined safety limits. If the readings indicate that a wire is hanging below the safe threshold, the system triggers an alert.</li>
        <li class="project1 wires"><snap ="color-change">Alerts and Notifications:</snap> Once the CMS detects that a wire is hanging dangerously low, it sends out alerts. These can be in the form of alarms, notifications to maintenance personnel, or even automated messages to the responsible authorities.</li>
        <li class="project1 wires"><snap ="color-change">Maintenance Response:</snap> The system allows for real-time monitoring, so maintenance teams can be dispatched to the location where the issue is detected, preventing accidents or damage before they occur.</li>

          we, a team of seven developed a RC Plane with dual motors. The plane can carry a payload higher than its own weight.
          With a cruicial hardwork of 3 months by the team, we successfull achieved a functional model with high payload fraction.
          I have mainly taken care of the fuselage design and modelling.
          The journey was a complete roller coaster with lots of ups and downs with great learnings.
